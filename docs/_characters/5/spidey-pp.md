Spider-Man (Peter Parker) is uniquely strong in combination with other web-tile creators like [Spider-Gwen (Gwen Stacy)]({% link _characters/4/spidergwen.md %}) or [Miles Morales (Spider-Man)]({% link _characters/4/miles.md %}), as well as taking great advantage of Strike tile creators because of his multiple hit power in {% include ap.html color=green %} Arachnid Agility.

{% include ap.html color=red %} Web Shot is a tremendous potential source of damage when Spider-Man (Peter Parker) is combined with other 5* characters to take advantage of the tier&apos;s enhanced crit damage and cascade potential.

Optimal power layouts depend on whether he will operate with Black Bolt (Inhuman King) to take advantage of the possibility of {% include ap.html color=yellow %} The Silent King to generate a 5/5/5 effective power set when firing off the recommended attack sequence of {% include ap.html color=blue %} Stick Around followed by one or more {% include ap.html color=green %} Arachnid Agility, with {% include ap.html color=red %} Web Shot saved for last to retain the maximum number of hits in the {% include ap.html color=green %} Arachnid Agility sequence.
