Spider-Man (Peter Parker) is uniquely strong in combination with other web-tile creators like <a href="/spidergwen/">Spider-Gwen (Gwen Stacy)</a> or <a href="/miles/">Miles Morales (Spider-Man)</a>, as well as taking great advantage of Strike tile creators because of his multiple hit power in {% include ap.html color='green' %} Arachnid Agility.

{% include ap.html color='red' %} Web Shot is a tremendous potential source of damage when Spider-Man (Peter Parker) is combined with other 5* characters to take advantage of the tier&apos;s enhanced crit damage and cascade potential.

Optimal power layouts depend on whether he will operate with <a href="/bb/">Black Bolt (Inhuman King)</a> to take advantage of the possibility of {% include ap.html color='yellow' %} The Silent King to generate a 5/5/5 effective power set when firing off the recommended attack sequence of {% include ap.html color='blue' %} Stick Around followed by one or more {% include ap.html color='green' %} Arachnid Agility, with {% include ap.html color='red' %} Web Shot saved for last to retain the maximum number of hits in the {% include ap.html color='green' %} Arachnid Agility sequence.
