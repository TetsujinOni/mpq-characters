Iron Man is not a terrible choice for your 1* character, and it may not be worth dropping him to develop a Juggernaut if you already have him developed. Iron Man is also not a big, ugly Dark Avenger.

{% include ap.html color='red' %} Repulsor Blast does damage. It also doesn't hurt your own character.

{% include ap.html color='yellow' %} Armored Assault does less damage and creates a few (up to 4) protect tiles.

{% include ap.html color='blue' %} Ultra-Freon Beam does a lot of damage and stuns its target, for up to 3 turns. It also costs 19, so you probably will almost never find a use for this.
