Tier: Low -- Suggested Build: {% include ap.html color='purple' %}5/{% include ap.html color='black' %}5

This is a limited character, which can only be acquired through the random rewards given from PVP battles. This is impractical barring astronomical odds, and is likely only collected as a trophy or for completeness.

{% include ap.html color='purple' %} Lethal Recon is very similar to [Black Widow's Aggressive Recon]({% link _characters/1/black widow-modern.md %}), but does a small amount of damage and costs 3 more at all covers.

{% include ap.html color='black' %} Payback Mission replaces enemy special tiles with critical tiles and deals damage. It costs 13 AP, though.

Yelena also has {% include ap.html color='blue' %} for color coverage, but no ability.

All the 1* champions with only two abilities reach a maximum level of 40, instead of 50.
