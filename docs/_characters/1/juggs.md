Tier: High -- Suggested Build: {% include ap.html color='green' %}5/{% include ap.html color='red' %}5

New player note: Once you leave the 1* tier, you want to keep exactly one 1* character for Deadpool daily quests. Juggernaut is advised to due his incredible speed at this job, although <a href="/im35/">Iron Man (Model 35)</a> and <a href="/1spidey/">Spider-man (Original)</a> can also do reasonably at this task. 

At 5 covers {% include ap.html color='green' %}Unstoppable Crash destroys 16 tiles for the low price of 6 AP. This will not give AP, but does damage, and will usually cause cascades.

At a very cheap 6 AP {% include ap.html color='red' %} Headbutt does a huge amount of damage and hurts yourself, but you don't care because you aren't going to use a 1* for more than one fight a day after you get into 2* land.

Juggs also has {% include ap.html color='black' %} for color coverage, but no ability.

All the 1* champions with only two abilities reach a maximum level of 40, instead of 50.
