{% include ap.html color='green' %} Lightning Strike destroy tiles for damage and AP. This starts at 8 tiles and increases to 14 at five covers. This is a solid ability at its cost of 10.

{% include ap.html color='yellow' %} Mistress of the Elements destroys Team-Up tiles for their AP and dealing a set amount of damage for each one. At higher covers the damage is increased, and the number increases. At 5 covers, it destroys 1 additional tile and does 30% more damage than at 3 covers. This ability costs 9.

{% include ap.html color='black' %} Hailstorm costs 9, and like its namesake hits for minor damage many times. At 5 covers this creates 32 Attack tiles, which each don't do much damage, but with half the board covered, the damage adds up. At 3 covers this creates 20 Attack tiles.
