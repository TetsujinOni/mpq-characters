Tier: Low -- Suggested Build: {% include ap.html color='black' %}5/{% include ap.html color='purple' %}5

{% include ap.html color='black' %} Devour is expensive at 12 AP. It deals damage, but will deal more if you can manage to get 8 web tiles on the board. 8 web tiles is not impossible, but is incredibly impratical.

{% include ap.html color='purple' %} Symbiote Snare has a low cost, and at 5 covers will unconditionally snare the opponent while creating a web tile. At lower covers, this needs a minimum number of web tiles to function. [Spider-Man(Original)]({% link _characters/1/spider-man-original.md %}) not only does not create web tiles to help, but also outshines Venom in all other ways anyway.


Venom also has {% include ap.html color='green' %} for color coverage, but no ability. Note that for some reason this is Venom's strongest color.

All the 1* champions with only two abilities reach a maximum level of 40, instead of 50.
