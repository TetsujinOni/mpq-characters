Tier: Mid -- Suggested Build: {% include ap.html color='purple' %}5/{% include ap.html color='red' %}5

{% include ap.html color='purple' %} Take Aim is a decent ability. At 5 covers, it costs 8 and turns a basic or protect tile into a critical tile. This is notably as Hawkeye actually has a very high critical hit multiplier.

{% include ap.html color='red' %} Arrow Stab is also a decent ability. It lets you target a row, which is cleared, dealing damage. It only costs 7 at 5 covers.

Hawkeye also has {% include ap.html color='yellow' %} for color coverage, but no ability.

All the 1* champions with only two abilities reach a maximum level of 40, instead of 50.
