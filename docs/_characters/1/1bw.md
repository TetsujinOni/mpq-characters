Tier: Mid -- Suggested Build: {% include ap.html color='purple' %}5/{% include ap.html color='blue' %}5

{% include ap.html color='blue' %} Widow's sting is actually a good enough stun to warrant discussion. <a href="/2storm/">Storm (Classic)</a> easily replaces any need for this stun in the 2* tier, though.

{% include ap.html color='purple' %} Aggressive Recon steals AP, and does nothing else. Stealing itself not awful, but this is still too expensive without having a purple generator. At 5 covers, this costs 16, and steals 4 of each color. This is most likely to be found ruining your already miserable day when the AI gets massively good luck in some random node.

Black Widow also has {% include ap.html color='yellow' %} for color coverage, but no ability.

All the 1* champions with only two abilities reach a maximum level of 40, instead of 50.
