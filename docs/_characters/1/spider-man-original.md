Spider-Man is not a terrible choice for your 1* character, and it may not be worth dropping him to develop a Juggernaut if you already have him developed. Spider-Man is also Spider-Man, which is more than can be said for Juggernaut.

{% include ap.html color='red' %} Web swing costs 6 and deals damage. It also doesn't hurt you when you use it.

{% include ap.html color='blue' %} All Tied Up only costs 6, and will stun at any number of covers. It also deals damage. 

{% include ap.html color='purple' %} Spectacular Strategy only costs 6 (surprise!), creates 2 random critical tiles, and deals damage. Extremely efficient at the expense of possibly also helping your enemy.
